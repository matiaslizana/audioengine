// GameEngine_Tests.cpp : This file contains the 'main' function. Program execution begins and ends there.
//

#include <iostream>
#include "catch.h"

#define CONFIG_CATCH_MAIN

//see https://medium.com/dsckiit/a-guide-to-using-catch2-for-unit-testing-in-c-f0f5450d05fb
// shows basic example of how to create catch 2 tests.
// more info: https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2

// The macro above defines the main function.
// all you need is to create new .cpp files and add the header to that, and make sure they're compiled.
// That way all tests will be run, when you run this file.
